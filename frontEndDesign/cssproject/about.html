	<h3>Our History</h3>
	<h4>Part 1</h4>
	<p>It all started with a cold root beer on a warm day. Meal Paradise was founded in 1851 as the first restaurant to serve the Seattle area. There were many cows and lobsters that were converted to meals for settlers.</p>
	<p>In 1891, King Edward VII of England visited Seattle to try the famous Lamb Bone meal at Meal Paradise. He wrote raving reviews for The Times of London during his journalism apprenticeship, which drew large crowds of tourists and created a need for many new chefs and waiters, some of which are still serving you today</p>
	<h4>Part 2</h4>
	<p>After countless hours of creating food from animals and vegetables, Meal Paradise opened a gift shop to sell t-shirts, stickers and badges. This was helpful for advertising and creating a new name for the business.</p>
	<p>In 1950 Queen Elizabeth II visited Meal Paradise and ate food and drank tea. This was historic and what Meal Paradise is all about.</p>
	<h4>The End</h4>
	<p>Now days, we are still doing the same thing that we did before but it is later. This is why we have an open sign that is always lit, even when we are closed, for your convenience.</p>
