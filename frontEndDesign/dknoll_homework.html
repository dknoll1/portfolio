<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I am a technologist and have worked with computers for <u>several</u> years. As a hobby, I have used <i>linux</i> for around 18 years, and always found programming fascinating but beyond my ability until I went and took courses and just <b>did</b> it. I have worked with HTML and CSS in the past for clients but often times with CMS and rarely from scratch. And also I have never learned Javascript. My first webpage was written from scratch when I was 13 years old and I wrote it for the developers of my favorite MUD client.
<p>Now that I have learned programming, I consider it a hobby. <blockquote>I have written code to create musical scores out of popular mathematical sequences to <font color="Tomato">entertain</font> myself.</blockquote></p>
<!-- Citing that I found 'Tomato' is a named HTML color on

Also I just tried to close a tag with </tomato> and wondered why it was bleeding, so I'm glad I'm taking this course.-->

<!-- Citing I remembered using "new" for the target to open in new tabs, but according to this answer, it looks like it should be _blank. I looked into it because the links were all opening in the same tab and loading over one another how I had it. They also said it will need rel="noopener noreferrer" to avoid a security risk..
