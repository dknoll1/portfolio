		<h2>Sefirot</h2><hr>
		<p><strong>Sefirot</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language" target="_blank">Hebrew</a>: סְפִירוֹת‎ səp̄îrôṯ), meaning <i>emanations</i>, are the 10 attributes/emanations in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah" target="_blank">Kabbalah</a>, through which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ein_Sof" target="_blank">Ein Sof</a> (The Infinite) reveals himself and continuously creates both the physical realm and the chain of higher metaphysical realms <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seder_hishtalshelus" target="_blank"><i>(Seder hishtalshelus)</i></a>. The term is alternatively transliterated into English as sephirot/sephiroth, singular sefirah/sephirah etc.</p>
		<!-- content from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefirot#Names_in_Cordoveran_Kabbalah -->
		<p>In Kabbalah, there is a direct correspondence between the Hebrew name of any spiritual or physical phenomenon and its manifestations in the mundane world. The Hebrew name represents the unique essence of the object. This reflects the belief that the universe is created through the metaphorical speech of God, as stated in the first chapter of Genesis. Kabbalah expounds on the names of the sefirot and their nuances, including their gematria (numerical values), in order to reach an understanding of these emanations of God's essence.</p>
		<p>In the 16th-century rational synthesis of Moses ben Jacob Cordovero (Cordoveran Kabbalah), the first complete systemisation of Kabbalah, the sefirot are listed from highest to lowest:</p>

		<h3 id = "one">Keter</h3>
		<!-- from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keter#Description -->
		<p>The first Sephirah is called the Crown, since a crown is worn above the head. The Crown therefore refers to things that are above the mind's abilities of comprehension. All of the other Sephirot are likened to the body which starts with the head and winds its way down into action. But the crown of a king lies above the head and connects the concept of "monarchy", which is abstract and intangible, with the tangible and concrete head of the king.</p>
		<p>This first Sefirah represents the primal stirrings of intent in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ein_Soph" target="_blank">Ein Soph</a> (infinity), or the arousal of desire to come forth into the varied life of being. But in this sense, although it contains all the potential for content, it contains no content itself, and is therefore called 'Nothing', 'The Hidden Light', 'The air that cannot be grasped'. Being desire to bring the world into being, Keter is absolute compassion.</p>
		<p>The organ associated to the first sefirot is the skull.</p>
		<h3 id = "two">Chochma</h3>
		<!-- from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chokhmah -->
		<p>Chokhmah, the second of the ten sefirot, is the first power of conscious intellect within Creation, and the first point of 'real' existence, since Keter represents emptiness. According to the book of Job, "Wisdom comes from nothingness". This point is both infinitely small, and yet encompasses the whole of being, but it remains incomprehensible until it is given shape and form in Binah.</p>
		<p>The organ associated to the second sefirot is the right side of the brain.</p>
		<h3 id = "three">Bina</h3>
		<!-- from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binah_(Kabbalah)#Description -->
		<p>Binah is 'intuitive understanding', or 'contemplation'. It is likened to a 'palace of mirrors' that reflects the pure point of light of Chokhmah, wisdom, increasing and multiplying it in an infinite variety of ways. In this sense, it is the 'quarry', which is carved out by the light of wisdom. It is the womb, which gives shape to the Spirit of God. On a psychological level, Binah is "processed wisdom," also known as deductive reasoning. It is davar mitoch davar—understanding one idea from another idea. While Chokhmah is intellect that does not emanate from the rational process (it is either inspired or taught), Binah is the rational process that is innate in the person which works to develop an idea fully.</p>
		<p>The organ associated to the third sefirot is the left side of the brain.</p>
		<h3 id = "four">Chesed</h3>
		<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesed#Kabbalah -->
		<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahir" target="_blank"><i>Bahir</i></a> states, "What is the fourth (utterance): The fourth is the righteousness of God, His mercies and kindness with the entire world. This is the right hand of God." Chesed manifests God's absolute, unlimited benevolence and kindness.</p>
		<p>The organ associated to the fourth sefirot is the right arm.</p>
		<h3 id = "five">Gevurah</h3>
		<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gevurah -->
		<p>Gevurah is associated in the soul with the power to restrain one's innate urge to bestow goodness upon others, when the recipient of that good is judged to be unworthy and liable to misuse it. As the force which measures and assesses the worthiness of Creation, Gevurah is also referred to in Kabbalah as "Midat Hadin" ("the attribute of judgment"). It is the restraining might of Gevurah which allows one to overcome his enemies, be they from without or from within (his evil inclination).</p>
		<p>Chesed and Gevurah act together to create an inner balance in the soul's approach to the outside world. While the "right arm" of Chesed operates to draw others near, the "left arm" of Gevurah reserves the option of repelling those deemed undeserving. (Even towards those to whom one's initial relation is that of "the left arm repels", one must subsequently apply the complementary principle of "the right arm draws near".)</p>
		<p>The organ associated to the fifth sefirot is the left arm.</p>
		<h3 id = "six">Tiferet</h3>
		<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiferet#Description -->
		<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahir" target="_blank"><i>Bahir</i></a> states: "Sixth is the adorned, glorious, delightful throne of glory, the house of the world to come. Its place is engraved in wisdom as it says 'God said: Let there be light, and there was light.'"</p>
		<p>Tiferet is the force that integrates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefira" target="_blank">Sefira</a> of Chesed ("compassion") and Gevurah ("Strength, or Judgment (din)"). These two forces are, respectively, expansive (giving) and restrictive (receiving). Either of them without the other could not manifest the flow of Divine energy; they must be balanced in perfect proportion by balancing compassion with discipline. This balance can be seen in the role of Tiferet, wherein the conflicting forces are harmonized, and creation flowers forth. Tiferet also balances Netzach and Hod in a similar manner. In that case Hod can be seen as the intellect where Netzach is seen as emotion.</p>
		<p>The organ associated to the sixth sefirot is the torso.</p>

		<h3 id = "seven">Netzach</h3>
		<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netzach -->
		<p>Netzach (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language" target="_blank">Hebrew</a>: נצח‎, "eternity") is the seventh of the ten Sefirot in the Jewish mystical system of Kabbalah. It is located beneath Chesed ('loving-kindness'), at the base of the "Pillar of Mercy" which also consists of Chochmah ('wisdom'). Netzach generally translates to 'eternity', and in the context of Kabbalah refers to 'perpetuity', 'victory', or 'endurance'.</p>
		<p>Netzach is "endurance," the fortitude, and patience to follow through on your passions. It is paired with Hod as the righteous attributes related to group interactivity, with Netzach being leadership, the ability to rally others to a cause and motivate them to act; while Hod is community, the ability to do the footwork needed to follow through on ideas and make them happen.</p>
		<p>The organ associated to the seventh sefirot is the right leg or right kidney.</p>
		<h3 id = "eight">Hod</h3>
		<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hod_(Kabbalah) -->
		<p>Hod (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language" target="_blank">Hebrew</a> הוד howd "majesty, splendour, glory") is the eighth sephira of the Kabbalistic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life_(Kabbalah)" target="_blank">Tree of Life</a>.</p>
		<p>Hod is explained as an analogy - that instead of "conquering" an obstacle in one's way, (which is the idea of Netzach), subduing oneself to that "obstacle" is related to the quality of Hod.</p>
		<p>The organ associated to the eigth sefirot is the left leg or left kidney.</p>
		<h3 id = "nine">Yesod</h3>
		<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yesod -->
		<p>According to Jewish Kabbalah, Yesod is the foundation upon which God has built the world. It also serves as a transmitter between the sephirot above, and the reality below. The light of the upper sephirot gather in Yesod and are channelled to Malkuth below. In this manner, Yesod is associated with the sexual organs. The masculine Yesod collects the vital forces of the sephirot above, and transmits these creative and vital energies into the feminine Malkuth below. Yesod channels, Malkuth receives. In turn, it is through Malkuth that the earth is able to interact with the divinity.</p>
		<p>The organ associated to the ninth sefirot is the sexual organ.</p>
		<h3 id = "ten">Malkuth</h3>
		<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malkuth -->
		<p>Malkuth means Kingdom. It is associated with the realm of matter/earth and relates to the physical world, the planets and the Solar System. It is important not to think of this sephirah as "unspiritual". Even though Malkuth is the emanation "furthest" from the Divine Source, it is still on the Tree of Life and therefore has its own unique spiritual qualities. It is often said that Kether (the "highest" sephira) is in Malkuth and Malkuth is in Kether. As the receiving sphere of all the other sephiroth, Malkuth gives tangible form to the other emanations. The Divine energy comes down and finds its expression in this plane, and our purpose as human beings is to bring that energy back around the circuit again and back up the Tree.</p>
		<p>The organ associated to the tenth sefirot is the mouth or feet.</p>
