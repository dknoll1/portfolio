			<p>The first ball projectiles were made of stone and shaped by stonemasons. Often they were hewn from local rocks on the spot during sieges. These stone balls caused little damage to castle walls, smashing into small splinters on impact, but the small shards wreaked havoc with the defenders.</p>
			
			<p>Later, around 1500 AD, stone balls were replaced by iron and lead balls, and proved much more effective for smashing down castle walls. Being a more perfectly shaped ball, they allowed less gas to escape around the ball as it was fired up the cannon’s barrel. Thus they were more powerful, and were used to batter castle walls. They would also cut down wide swaths of soldiers or cavalry unfortunate enough to get in their way, “taking off the odd head here and there”. Spent iron balls were dutifully collected by the enemy, melted down and recast for their own cannonballs.</p>

			<p id="hovertxt">Arrow-shaped projectiles were fired from pots de feu, and used primarily against men-at-arms on the battlefield. The projectiles were large metal arrows, bound by leather wrappings, and rammed into the gun barrel.</p>

			<p id="hovertxt">Many different cannons of widely differing lengths, calibers, and bores, were created, depending on their purpose. During the Tudor period, names of birds and mythical animals like Robinet, Falcon, Serpentine, Culverine (a mythical serpent that spat fire and smoke), Dragon, and Basilisk, were given to some types of cannon. Other general categories of cannon common during the 15th and 16th centuries include the Saker, Culverin, Minion, Veuglaire, and Ribaldequin. Many sub-categories of these cannons were cast, all with their own characteristics.</p>
