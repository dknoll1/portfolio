			<h3>Science & Technology</h3>
			<p>Among the formally educated, if not among the general population, traditional science was transformed by the new heliocentric, mechanistic, and mathematical conceptions of Copernicus, Harvey, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton. Historians of science are increasingly reluctant to describe these changes as a revolution, since this implies too sudden and complete an overthrow of the earlier model. Aristotle’s authority gave way very slowly, and only the first of the great scientists mentioned above did his work in the period under consideration. Still, the Renaissance made some important contributions toward the process of paradigm shift, as the 20th-century historian of science Thomas Kuhn called major innovations in science.</p>

			<h3>Flying Machine</h3>
			<img src="images/flying.jpg" alt="flying machine" class="fullw">
			<p id="hovertxt">Of Leonardo da Vinci’s many areas of study, perhaps this Renaissance man’s favorite was the area of aviation. Da Vinci seemed truly excited by the possibility of people soaring through the skies like birds.<br><br>One of da Vinci’s most famous inventions, the flying machine (also known as the "ornithopter") ideally displays his powers of observation and imagination, as well as his enthusiasm for the potential of flight. The design for this invention is clearly inspired by the flight of winged animals, which da Vinci hoped to replicate. In fact, in his notes, he mentions bats, kites and birds as sources of inspiration.</p>

			<h3>Combat Machine</h3>
			<img src="images/combat.jpg" alt="combat machine" class="fullw">
			<p id="hovertxt">The original machines and engineering diagrams of Leonardo da Vinci were without doubt a high point of the italian renaissance in relation to technological innovation. But his work was not produced in isolation. It seems reasonably certain that da Vinci had access to technical manuscripts produced earlier in the 15th century, written at the beginning of the surge in scientific, artistic and technological pursuits that was destined to spread across Europe.</p>

			<h3>Mechanical Engineering</h3>

			<p id="hovertxt2">The medieval and Renaissance periods in Europe span the time from approximately AD 500 to AD 1600. Life in medieval Europe has often been characterized as the “dark ages,” which gives the impression that there were no advances in technology or engineering. In some aspects, this characterization is correct. For example, the elaborate water works created by the Romans to supply their cities with potable water were not duplicated in medieval European cities. Neither were sanitary sewers. Thus, waterborne disease was a recurring problem in many of these cities. However, in other aspects this characterization is not correct. Several important engineering concepts and techniques were developed during this time which laid the foundation for rapid technological advance during the Industrial Revolution. Engineers developed techniques for constructing astounding buildings, including cathedrals and castles. Engineers also improved the designs of ships, making European exploration of the rest of the world possible. The development of the printing press and associated type technology, as well as the development of linear perspective and engineering drawing techniques, enabled literacy and communication of information.</p>

			<h3>Printing Press</h3>
			<img src="images/printingpress.jpg" alt="World's First Printing Press(kind of)" class="fullw">
			<p id="hovertxt">The most important invention of the Renaissance, and perhaps in the history of the world, was the printing press. It was invented by German Johannes Gutenberg around 1440. By 1500 there were printing presses throughout Europe. The printing press allowed for information to be distributed to a wide audience. This helped to spread new scientific discoveries as well, allowing scientists to share their works and learn from each other.</p>

			<h3>Sir Isaac Newton</h3>
			<img src="images/newton.jpg" alt="Isaac Newton sitting by a tree" class="fullw">
			<p id="hovertxt">Isaac Newton changed the way we understand the Universe. Revered in his own lifetime, he discovered the laws of gravity and motion and invented calculus.</p>
