				<p>1. The SDEV 280 Capstone project I chose to do was an analysis of github data on the Linux kernel changes overtime. I assumed this would expand my git knowledge as well as provide some insight into how this operating system has evolved. 
				<p>2. There were a few obstacles to completing the notebook. The first was the seaborn implementation and graph, it took some time to find the right imports and syntax to create a visualization of the data. The other obstacle was finding correct up-to-date data to work with. This was solved by creaing my own log in git.
				<p>3. <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lc_1SQuS8xGSAZae8l5NPeXc6HQRiDxQ?usp=sharing" target=0>Google Colab Notebook</a> (Originally copied from DataCamp) The features I added were a new dataset from git, modifications to enter the correct datetime parameters to match the new data, and corrected visualization and conclusionary statements about the year with the most commits.
				<p>4. This project could be improved with a little more automation. Such as finding the max commits per year automatically from the dataset upon adding future data.  This is something I wanted to add but didn't have time to do.
				<p>5. Because a lot of the course was spent learning the Agile MindSet, it was applied to this project upon switching to an individual task from DataCamp. It was helpful to apply this methodology to adding new features and generally affecting this data. 
				<p>6. It was interesting that so many git log entries have the wrong date. Modifying the oldest and newest possible dates and trimming the excess was a very interesting aspect ensuring there are proper conclusions in the project. A difficulty was in uploading this notebook to work with the PyCharm IDE. It was worth doing in the end, but a bit of a learning curve involved to have things working correctly and in the correct version of the IDE.
				<p>7. I think the course went well and was a great example of Agile methodology. One improvement, as previously discussed, could be to set up an IDE from the very beginning of a python course to enable more versitility to students working in Python by the time they are in this capstone class. 
				<p>8. Completed the DataCamp project, 'Exploring the Evolution of Linux' and added my own functionality that updated the dataset used, modified the parameters for visualization and produced up-to-date conclusions about the history of Linux.
